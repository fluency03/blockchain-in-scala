Simple Blockchain Implementation in Scala.

Inspired by [Daniel van Flymen](http://www.dvf.nyc/)'s blog [Learn Blockchains by Building One](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46), I started to implement this Scala version of a simple Blockchain.

REST API service is built on the open source projects [akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) and [akka-http](https://github.com/akka/akka-http).
